ðŸ”¹ Admin Dashboard: Manages parking space availability, user bookings, and payment records.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Updates: Ensures parking status is continuously updated.<br>

**Technologies Used:**<br>
ðŸ”¹ Programming Language: Java (for backend logic).<br>
ðŸ”¹ Database: MySQL (for storing user data, bookings, and payment details).<br>
ðŸ”¹ Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend).<br>
ðŸ”¹ Frameworks & Libraries: JDBC (for database connectivity).<br>
ðŸ”¹ Security Measures: Encrypted login credentials and secure payment gateway integration.<br>

**Implementation Highlights:**<br>
